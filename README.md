### Key Advantages

- **Privacy-Focused:** Operates entirely locally, requiring no internet access.
- **Data Security:** All data remains on your device, ensuring your privacy.
- **Performance Optimized:** Supports inference on AI PC's Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for enhanced efficiency.

This project was developed as part of [Google Summer of Code 2024](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024) under the [OpenVINO Toolkit](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit), mentored by [Dmitriy Pastushenkov](https://github.com/DimaPastushenkov), [Ria Cheruvu](https://github.com/riacheruvu), and [ZhuoWu](https://github.com/zhuo-yoyowz). For more details, visit the [GSoC Project Page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/QUbIeRAM).

## Features

### **Performance and Efficiency**

- **Real-time Gaze Tracking:** Local processing ensures accurate and private screen-time monitoring.
- **Device Switching:** Easily toggle between CPU, GPU, and NPU for optimal performance.
- **Edge Inference:** Leverage edge devices for faster and more efficient processing.
- **Performance Optimization:** Switch between quantized weights and control frame processing limits.
- **Resource Monitoring:** Track system resources for efficient performance.
- **Built with C++:** Developed using C++, a low-level language close to the system, ensuring high performance with memory efficiency.
