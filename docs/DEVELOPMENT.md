# VisionGuard Development Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up, building, and running the VisionGuard application on your local system. It includes guidance for both Windows and Unix-based systems (macOS/Linux).

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the build process, ensure that the following dependencies are installed on your system:

- **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (Windows only):** Required for running applications built with Visual Studio.
- **NPU Drivers:** Necessary for enabling hardware acceleration on systems equipped with a Neural Processing Unit (NPU).
- **[OpenVINO Toolkit](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_windows.html):** Provides pre-trained models and optimization tools for running inference on various devices.
- **[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/releases/):** An open-source computer vision library used for image and video processing.
- **[Qt6](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/gettingstarted.html):** A framework for developing cross-platform applications with graphical user interfaces.

### Installation of Dependencies

- **OpenVINO:** Follow the official [OpenVINO installation guide](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_windows.html) to set up OpenVINO on your system.
- **OpenCV:** You can download and build OpenCV from the [official repository](https://github.com/opencv/opencv). Make sure to configure it for your specific platform.
- **Qt6:** Download and install Qt6 from the [official Qt website](https://www.qt.io/download). Ensure that you install the correct version that matches your platform and compiler (e.g., MSVC 2019 for Windows).

## Setup and Build Instructions

### Windows Setup

#### Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables

Environment variables are necessary to tell the build system where to find the installed libraries and tools. Open a terminal and set the following environment variables:

```bash
set OpenVINO_DIR=C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\OpenVINO\runtime\cmake
set OpenCV_DIR=C:\Program Files\opencv\build
set Qt6_DIR=C:\Qt\6.7.1\msvc2019_64
```

#### Step 2: Create and Navigate to the Build Directory

Create a build directory where the compiled binaries will be stored. This keeps your source files clean and separates the build artifacts.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

#### Step 3: Configure the Build System with CMake

CMake is a cross-platform build system generator. The following command configures CMake to generate a build system using Visual Studio 2019 for a 64-bit architecture:

```bash
cmake -A x64 -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ^
      -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="%Qt6_DIR%" ^
      -DOpenCV_DIR="%OpenCV_DIR%" ^
      -DOpenVINO_DIR="%OpenVINO_DIR%" ^
      -DOMZ_MODELS_DIR="C:\Users\Inba\Documents\GSoC\VisionGuard\omz_models" ^
      ..
```

- **`-A x64`**: Specifies a 64-bit build.
- **`-G "Visual Studio 16 2019"`**: Tells CMake to generate a project for Visual Studio 2019.
- **`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`**: Configures the build type. Use `Release` for an optimized build or `Debug` for debugging.
- **`-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`**: Specifies the paths for Qt6, OpenCV, and OpenVINO.

#### Step 4: Build the Project

After configuration, use CMake to build the project. The `--parallel` option allows you to specify the number of threads to use during the build process. Setting it to `-1` or `0` will automatically use the maximum number of available threads.

```bash
cmake --build . --config Release --parallel 0 --verbose
```

- **`--config Release`**: Specifies that this build should be optimized for performance. For a debug build, replace `Release` with `Debug`.
- **`--parallel 0`**: Utilizes the maximum number of threads available on your system to speed up the build process.
- **`--verbose`**: Outputs detailed information during the build process, which can be helpful for troubleshooting.

### Unix-Based Systems (macOS/Linux)

#### Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables

First, source the OpenVINO environment setup script to load the necessary environment variables. Then, set the variables for OpenCV and Qt6:

```bash
source /opt/intel/openvino/bin/setupvars.sh
export OpenVINO_DIR=/opt/intel/openvino/runtime/cmake
export OpenCV_DIR=/usr/local/share/opencv4
export Qt6_DIR=/opt/Qt/6.7.1/gcc_64
```

#### Step 2: Create and Navigate to the Build Directory

Create the build directory:

```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/VisionGuard/build
cd /path/to/VisionGuard/build
```

#### Step 3: Configure the Build System with CMake

Configure CMake with the following command:

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
      -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$Qt6_DIR" \
      -DOpenCV_DIR="$OpenCV_DIR" \
      -DOpenVINO_DIR="$OpenVINO_DIR" \
      -DOMZ_MODELS_DIR="/path/to/VisionGuard/omz_models" \
      /path/to/VisionGuard
```

- **`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`**: Configures the build for debugging. For an optimized release build, replace `Debug` with `Release`.

#### Step 4: Build the Project

Build the project with the following command, using all available CPU cores:

```bash
cmake --build . --config Debug --parallel 0
```

### Running the Application

Once the build process is complete, you can run the VisionGuard application:

- **Windows:** Navigate to the build directory and run `VisionGuardApp.exe`.
- **macOS/Linux:** Navigate to the build directory and run the generated executable (e.g., `./VisionGuardApp`).

### Understanding Build Types

- **Release Build:** 
  - Optimized for performance.
  - Use this build type when deploying or running the application in a production environment.

- **Debug Build:**
  - Includes debug symbols and is not optimized for performance.
  - Use this build type during development when you need to debug the application.

## Additional Notes

If you change the environment variables or CMake options, itâ€™s often necessary to clear the cache (by deleting the build directory and recreating it) to ensure that all changes are applied correctly.
