### Client

The client consists of two main components:

1. **Main Window Application**: Provides the primary user interface.
2. **System Tray Application**: Runs in the background within the OS system tray.

### Gaze Detection Engine

The heart of VisionGuard is its gaze detection engine, leveraging several models from the OpenVINO model zoo:

- Face Detection: [`face-detection-retail-0005`](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/omz_models_model_face_detection_retail_0005.html)
- Head Pose Estimation: [`head-pose-estimation-adas-0001`](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/omz_models_model_head_pose_estimation_adas_0001.html)
- Facial Landmark Detection: [`facial-landmarks-35-adas-0002`](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/omz_models_model_facial_landmarks_35_adas_0002.html)
- Eye State Estimation: [`open-closed-eye-0001`](https://docs.openvino.ai/2022.3/omz_models_model_open_closed_eye_0001.html)
- Gaze Estimation: [`gaze-estimation-adas-0002`](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/omz_models_model_gaze_estimation_adas_0002.html)

### Calibration Process

One of the most critical aspects of ensuring VisionGuard’s accuracy is the calibration process. Accurate calibration is essential for precise gaze tracking, as it directly influences how well the application can detect and respond to where the user is looking on the screen. The calibration process I developed is both user-friendly and technically robust, designed to adapt to various screen sizes and user positions.

#### Four-Point Gaze Capture

The calibration process begins with a **Four-Point Gaze Capture**. Users are prompted to focus on four green dots that appear sequentially in the corners of the screen. This step is crucial for gathering data on the user's gaze behavior from different angles. The process ensures that multiple gaze points are captured for each corner, improving the overall accuracy of the calibration.

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="four_point_calibration.png" alt="Four-Point Calibration" width="500"/>
</div>

*Figure: A screen with four green dots representing the four-point calibration process.*

#### Convex Hull Calculation

Once the gaze data is captured, the next step is the **Convex Hull Calculation**. The system takes all the captured gaze points and computes the smallest polygon that can enclose these points, known as the convex hull. This polygon represents the boundary within which the user's gaze is expected to fall.

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="convex_hull.png" alt="Convex Hull Calculation" width="500"/>
</div>

*Figure: Visualization of the convex hull enclosing the captured gaze points.*

#### Error Margin Application

To account for potential inaccuracies in gaze detection, an **Error Margin Application** is performed. The convex hull is expanded by a predetermined margin (typically 150 pixels) to create a buffer zone. This extension ensures that slight deviations in gaze tracking won’t lead to incorrect detections.

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="error_margin.png" alt="Error Margin Application" width="500"/>
</div>

*Figure: The error margin applied to the convex hull to account for tracking inaccuracies.*

#### Final Calibration Point Determination

The final step in the calibration process is determining the **Final Calibration Points**. The extended convex hull is intersected with the screen boundaries, and the resulting points form the final calibration set. These points are crucial for accurate gaze tracking, ensuring that the system can reliably detect whether the user is looking at the screen.

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="final_calibration.png" alt="Final Calibration Points" width="500"/>
</div>

*Figure: The final calibration points determined after applying the error margin.*

This comprehensive calibration process not only improves accuracy but also enhances the user experience by making the setup process straightforward and reliable.

### Frame Processing and Gaze Time Update Algorithm

At the core of VisionGuard’s functionality is its ability to process video frames in real time and update gaze-related metrics. This system works by analyzing each frame captured by the webcam to determine the user’s gaze direction and then updating the screen time metrics accordingly.

#### Face and Gaze Detection

The process starts with **Face and Gaze Detection**. Using models from the OpenVINO toolkit, the application first detects the user’s face and then estimates their gaze direction. This step is critical as it forms the basis for all subsequent calculations.

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="face_gaze_detection.png" alt="Face and Gaze Detection" width="500"/>
</div>

*Figure: The face and gaze detection process, which identifies the user’s gaze direction.*

#### Gaze Screen Intersection

Once the gaze direction is estimated, the next step is to calculate the **Gaze Screen Intersection**. Here, the 3D gaze vector is projected onto the 2D screen plane. This conversion is essential to determine whether the user is looking at the screen and, if so, where on the screen their gaze is focused.

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="gaze_screen_intersection.png" alt="Gaze Screen Intersection" width="500"/>
</div>

*Figure: Illustration of the gaze vector intersecting with the 2D screen plane.*

#### Gaze Time Update

Based on the intersection point, the system then performs a **Gaze Time Update**. If the user’s gaze is on the screen and their eyes are open, the application accumulates screen time. Conversely, if the gaze is off the screen or the eyes are closed, the system updates the gaze lost duration. If this duration exceeds a specified threshold, the accumulated screen time is reset.

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="gaze_time_update.png" alt="Gaze Time Update" width="500"/>
</div>

*Figure: Flowchart showing how gaze time is updated based on user behavior.*

#### Visual Feedback and Performance Metrics

Finally, the system provides **Visual Feedback** by marking detected facial features and displaying the current gaze time and lost duration on the frame. Alongside this, **Performance Metrics** such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and frame processing speed are tracked to ensure that VisionGuard runs efficiently.

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="visual_feedback.png" alt="Visual Feedback and Performance Metrics" width="500"/>
</div>

*Figure: Example of visual feedback provided by VisionGuard, along with performance metrics.*

### Point-in-Polygon Algorithm

Determining whether the user's gaze is within the screen boundaries is a critical task that VisionGuard accomplishes using a **Point-in-Polygon Algorithm**. Specifically, VisionGuard employs a ray-casting technique, which is a widely-used method for solving this problem.

#### How the Algorithm Works

The algorithm works by casting a ray from the gaze point and counting the number of intersections this ray has with the edges of the polygon representing the screen area. If the number of intersections is odd, the point lies inside the polygon; if even, it lies outside. This method is effective for both convex and concave polygons, making it highly adaptable.

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="point_in_polygon.png" alt="Point-in-Polygon Algorithm" width="500"/>
</div>

*Figure: Diagram illustrating how the ray-casting algorithm determines if a point is inside a polygon.*

The Point-in-Polygon algorithm is particularly suited for VisionGuard’s 3D gaze estimation as it accurately maps the 3D gaze vector onto the 2D screen space. This mapping is crucial for reliable screen time tracking and ensuring that users receive timely notifications to take breaks.

### Challenges and Learning

Throughout the GSoC experience, I encountered numerous challenges that significantly contributed to my learning and growth as a developer:

- **Cross-platform C++ Development**: Developing a cross-platform C++ application presented unique challenges, particularly in ensuring compatibility across different operating systems like macOS, Windows, and Linux. I faced difficulties with different compilers, such as issues compiling OpenVINO’s Model Zoo demo with MSVC 2022, which required troubleshooting and problem-solving to ensure smooth builds across platforms.
  
- **Understanding and Implementing CMake**: CMake, a powerful build system, required me to deepen my understanding of build configurations and dependencies. This knowledge was essential in managing the complexity of a cross-platform project like VisionGuard.

- **Low-Level Design Issues**: Navigating C++'s low-level design complexities, particularly with object-oriented principles (OOP), was challenging. Implementing robust design patterns while maintaining performance required careful consideration of memory management and efficiency.

- **Screen Calibration for Accurate Gaze Detection**: One of the more technically demanding tasks was calibrating the screen to accurately detect if the user was gazing at the screen. This required developing a reliable and user-friendly calibration process that could adapt to different screen sizes and user positions.

- **Adhering to C++ Development Standards**: Ensuring that VisionGuard adhered to modern C++ development standards was vital for the project’s long-term maintainability. I had to revise my approach to permissions and data storage, moving from storing stats in the current working directory to using appropriate libraries for handling resources securely and efficiently.

These challenges not only helped me improve VisionGuard but also significantly enhanced my problem-solving skills and understanding of cross-platform development.
